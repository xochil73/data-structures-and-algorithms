### Challenge
* Create a Node Class with properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node and the right child node
* Create a BinaryTree class with a defined method for the each of the depth first traversals: preOrder, inOrder and postOrder
* Create a BinarySearchTree class, with a method called add that accepts a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree, and a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
