### Challenge
* Take in a tree as an argument and with vanilla javaScript, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
  -If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
  -If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
  -If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
